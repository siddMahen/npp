# TODO

* Add some methods to allow for the creation (and perhaps
deletion) of elements
* Make the `html.makeHTML` method work, also remove server 
side code pieces
* Build a node.js based npm package which accepts files
and return them parsed of all jpp
* Build some kind of module for nginx so this runs
automatically on files which are marked with PHP.
